v0.0.1 - 2/15/2019
==

- initial release
- supports custom flags:
  - `cache`: enable the http resource cache for the discovery of supported server resources
  - `namespace`: only consider resources from namespace (only applies to namespaced resources). Maybe not useful.
  - `only-scope`: one of `cluster`|`namespace` to restrict the resources by their scope
  - `config`: to use a config file (defunct)
  - `verbosity`: to set the log level

- sub-commands:
  - `completion` for command-line completion scripts (bash and zsh)
  - `version` to retrieve version information. (Note: `ketall version --full` prints a lot more than just version)
  - `help` to show a help text
